        "question": "Composer: Claudio Monteverdi\nYear: 1607\nLocation: Mantua, Italy\nSynopsis: With a mythological musician as hero, it ranks as the first great opera. Monteverdi was the \"founding father\" of operatic form. Euridice dies from a snake bite. The sorrowful Orpheus, through his music, tries to save her from the Underworld. A popular operatic subject (Gluck, Jaques Offenbach, Philip Glass), it is emotional, melancholy and transcendent.",

        "question": "Composer: Henry Purcell\nYear: 1689\nLocation: London, United Kingdom\nSynopsis: A lone English operatic success until the 20th century, the titular female recounts the tale of the tragic Queen of Carthage and her love for the titular male, inconveniently en route to found a new Troy. In addition to sailors and witches, Purcell gave us one of the most sublime laments in opera: the titular female's \"When I Am Laid in Earth.\"",

        "question": "Composer: George Frideric Handel\nYear: 1724\nLocation: London, United Kingdom\nSynopsis: An epic of love and war often considered Handel's finest work, it has a richly intricate plot and the bonus of a brilliantly characterised and outrageously seductive Cleopatra (see Glyndebourne's Opus Arte DVD with the dancing Danielle de Niese as Cleo). Written for castrato, it is often sung by a countertenor. Other good Handel: Rinaldo, Radamisto, Tamerlano, Rodelinda, Ariodante, Alcina.",

        "question": "Composer: Christoph Willibald Gluck\nYear: 1762\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\nSynopsis: Written in Italian, this intense drama was later revised as the French [titular male]. A mix of old and new styles, poised at the birth of Romanticism, this is regarded as one of the key operas of the 18th century. Maria Callas made J'ai Perdu Mon [titular female] a stand-alone hit.",

        "question": "Composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nYear: 1786\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\nSynopsis: Together with Don Giovanni and Cosi fan Tutte, which make up Mozart's trio of masterpieces with libretti by Da Ponte, it is for many the perfect opera: a balance of wit, humanity and astounding, glorious music. Others find it too long, and the garden scene dreary. The Queen called it \"the one about the [lost] pin\".",

        "question": "Composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nYear: 1791\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\nSynopsis: The monstrous Queen of the Night, the birdcatcher Papageno, lovers, philosophy, Freemasonry – this opera has it all. The music is ravishing, some of it probably familiar. Its prominent use of dialogue makes it a challenge to stage. Despite appearances, it's not as easy for children as it may look; wait a while. Mozart died only weeks after completing it.",

        "question": "Composer: Gioachino Rossini\nYear: 1816\nLocation: Rome, Italy\nSynopsis: Pure, inane, fizzing delight, ferociously difficult to sing: This opera, written in a fortnight by a composer who had penned 35 operas by the age of 37 then abruptly retired, tops the list of all operatic comedies.

        "question": "Composer: Gioachino Rossini\nYear: 1829\nLocation: Paris, France\nSynopsis: The [titular] overture is one of the most famous pieces of classical music. Yet Rossini's enormous, final opera, involving the fight for Swiss freedom, remains a rarity – despite thrilling arias and exciting choruses.

        "question": "Composer: Giuseppe Verdi\nYear: 1851\nLocation: Venice, Italy\nSynopsis: Verdi, one of opera's greats, had a long career. For many his Egyptian Aida is an ideal first opera. For dramatic intensity, this opera – compact, tuneful, melodramatic – is even better. The hunchback prompts pity when he tries to protect his daughter. It's never been the same since ENO's 1982 \"Mafioso\" staging had the Duke singing La Donna e Mobile at a jukebox in a diner.",

        "question": "Composer: Giuseppe Verdi\nYear: 1853\nLocation: Venice, Italy\nSynopsis: Perhaps Verdi's most performed work, this opera contains all the elements of operatic addiction: a beautiful, consumptive, fallen-woman heroine, grand Parisian party scenes, the travails of love, a troubled father and a deathbed scene, all set to Verdi's faultless score. Hard to beat.",

        "question": "Composer: Giuseppe Verdi\nYear: 1867\nLocation: Paris, France\nSynopsis: Known in both its French and Italian versions, this enormous five-act work based on Schiller shows Verdi at the height of his powers. Politics, kingship, heresy, adultery and love combine with incomparable pomp and solemnity, with a score to match. The bass role of King Philip II of Spain is one of opera's loneliest.",

        "question": "Composer: Giuseppe Verdi\nYear: 1893\nLocation: Milan, Italy\nSynopsis: Like Otello (written in a final, brilliant outpouring in 1887), this opera – after Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor – is a Verdian favourite among buffs, though some find its quixotic, quick-fire charms less beguiling. Knowledge of the final fugue, celebrating the folly of the human condition (Tutto nel Mondo) is essential to any opera lover's armament.",

        "question": "Composer: Giacomo Puccini\nYear: 1896\nLocation: Turin, Italy\nSynopsis: If Puccini himself cried after composing the final scene of this opera, one of the most adored of all operas, how can the rest of us resist?

        "question": "Composer: Giacomo Puccini\nYear: 1926\nLocation: Milan, Rome\nSynopsis: Football fans know Nessun Dorma thanks to Pavarotti and the 1990 World Cup. Puccini's final opera is about the man-hating Chinese titular queen, and Calaf, the man who finally melts her icy heart. When Puccini died leaving the opera incomplete, it was finished by a composer friend, Alfano. Others have also tried, but Alfano's is the version commonly used.",

        "question": "Composer: Ludwig van Beethoven\nYear: 1805\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\nSynopsis: Written to a backdrop of revolution, Beethoven's only opera is a hymn to freedom and marital love. Leonora dresses as a man, the titular character, to rescue her husband Florestan from imprisonment.

        "question": "Composer: Richard Wagner\nYear: 1850\nLocation: Weimar, Germany\nSynopsis: Wagner's last \"early\" work (after Flying Dutchman, Tannhäuser) before his mature masterpieces. This is perhaps the last great Romantic opera, rich with symbolism, myth, taboo: the innocent Elsa of Brabant is accused of murdering her brother. A knight in shining armour arrives in a swan-drawn boat. He will help her so long as she doesn't ask his name. She does. You can guess what it is.",

        "question": "Composer: Richard Wagner\nYear: 1865\nLocation: Munich, Germany\nSynopsis: The ultimate, transcendent, no-holds-barred \"love in death\" experience, ending with Isolde's Liebestod. As usual, Wagner wrote his own libretto. The title female is betrothed to King Mark. After a mix-up, she and the titular male drink a love potion and fall cataclysmically in love. This is \"extreme opera\", full of ecstatic thrills in very slow motion, but worth every note. Be prepared.",

        "question": "Composer: Richard Wagner\nYear: 1879\nLocation: Beyreuth, Germany\nSynopsis: This opera's Cycle, a pinnacle of the genre, consists of four operas: Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried and Götterdammerung – which last about 15 hours in total and took Wagner 28 years to write. The story of gold, gods, giants, dragons, once you sort it all out, is really an epic exploration of man's desire, greed and folly.

        "question": "Composer: Georges Bizet\nYear: 1875\nLocation: Paris, France\nSynopsis: Is there an opera more popular, sexy, scandalous or with better tunes? The Gypsy dancer at the cigarette factory who breaks hearts and meets her doom outside the bullring offers an ideal start to opera. It's long, but the action is thrilling, the music infectious.

        "question": "Composer: Modest Mussorgsky\nYear: 1874\nLocation: St. Petersburg, Russia\nSynopsis: Experts still argue over which version of Mussorgsky's historical epic is definitive. The reluctant titular character, filled with foreboding and guilt for a murder, is appointed tsar. The people grow hungry and rebellious. Pretenders vie for the throne.

        "question": "Composer: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nYear: 1879\nLocation: Moscow, Russia\nSynopsis: Among the most intimate and heart-rending of operas, this setting of Pushkin's verse tale has a spectacular birthday ball, a duel and, early on, the Letter Scene, in which the impetuous young Tatyana pours out her heart to the cold titular character.

        "question": "Composer: Benjamin Britten\nYear: 1954\nLocation: Venice, Italy\nSynopsis: It's hard to choose a second representative Britten opera, from the equally enjoyable Billy Budd, Midsummer Night's Dream, Albert Herring or Death in Venice. But his setting of Henry James's ghost tale, this opera, about a governess, the two children in her care and two dead servants, makes this chamber opera one of the most dramatically appealing.
